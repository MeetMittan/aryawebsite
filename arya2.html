For instance, Chicago (CMOS) is often used in literary studies, while APA is found in psychology and psychiatry studies.

                <p class="para3">Academic writing is a formal style of writing used in universities and scholarly publications. It is characterized by a clear focus on the research topic, a formal tone, and the use of evidence to support arguments.

            <p class="para">Another type of academic texts — books — comes in various forms, including monographs, textbooks and edited volumes. Monographs are detailed studies on a single topic, often authored by one or a few experts, providing comprehensive insights and contributing significantly to a field. Textbooks, designed for educational purposes, cover broad subjects systematically and are used as primary teaching tools. Edited volumes compile chapters from different authors around a common theme, offering diverse perspectives on a topic.</p>
